# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# 2Files in the live playlist internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.

  plate: Alot On My Plate

    <p>
      I got a lot on my plate,<br>
      I ain’t got no time for no heartache.<br>
      And I got reasons I can’t say,<br>
      They don’t matter much anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just a little of this and a little of that,<br>
      And I left a little out there that I shoulda took back.<br>
      And a time or two it was you,<br>
      And a time or three it was me.
    </p>
    <p class='chorus'>
    	You tell your friends I’m crazy,<br>
    	I tell my friends you’re crazy,<br>
    	Now don’t you think that maybe,<br>
    	It’s time I stop calling you baby, baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      There’s better days up ahead,<br>
      I’m gonna travel that road alone instead,<br>
      Of having you at my side,<br>
      Making it a bumpy ride.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I’m sure I’ll see some nasty weather,<br>
      That I’ll float through lite as a feather.<br>
      And I’ll still have problems that I know,<br>
      but those problems will be my own.
